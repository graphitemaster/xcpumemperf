# Comparison of various CPU(s)

## How to read these results

The first line of the output is the detected CPU and it's topology, in
particular the amount of logical threads it has, followed by the amount
of physical cores it has and if a core supports multiple threads (also
known as SMT (Simultanerous multithreading))

The line containing trials tells you how many times the test is being
done, more trials results in more stable results to reduce scheduling
noise and overhead of thread construction and other sources of noise.
The space refers to the memory pool which will be mapped twice for
each thread pair (read and write threads in a pair and each get their
own virtual mapping for.) This space is continuously touched by both
processes while the system is under load to get an idea of cross CPU
memory performance. The thread pair is how many pairs of threads (it's
a pair because there is a thread for read and a thread for write) are
to be used in the trial. The final count is just the amount of actual
threads will be used in total for the run (it's always two times the
amount of thread pairs.)

The next line shows you how threads are allocated for the read and
write pairs, each `[]` is a pair and the first number in a pair is the
logical CPU which will be used for reading while the second number is
the logical CPU which will be used for writing. These are staggered
because we want reads and writes for a mapping to happen across CPUs.
This staggering is controlled by the amount of threads per core. You
can disable staggering with -F or --force-same-cpu.

The rest of the output is a list of running average seconds on each
thread pair that carried out the trials. This output serves to show how
the top most pairs tend to be the slowest while the bottom most ones are
faster, which proves that memory bandwidth scales with the thread count.
If you see values at the bottom of the list having averages higer than
the top then you've hit a pathological case where more threads makes
memory slower.

The final line is what can be used for comparison, in particular it tells
you how much memory was touched through the course of all trials for
all thread pairs and what the memory throughput of that was as well as
how long it took to benchmark everything. Systems with more threads will
take longer to benchmark but should have relatively stable memory
throughput.

## Configurations

The results of the configurations are organized by the amount of threads
used per trial run to make comparing the results much easier. Tho
you can still compare results against different threads per trial run
counts as described above.

The following are timings from various CPUs with the default options
of `xcpumempref`.

more configurations we have the better it'll be to provide some useful
graphs in the future.
